- [x] Make it accept a string parameter that controls which predicate is applied. You can use Swiftâ€™s string interpolation to place this in the predicate.
    - Finished already at commit:
        - 9ec40b659c0592165baa363b9be19ee43f1d8440
- [x] Modify the predicate string parameter to be an enum such as .beginsWith, then make that enum get resolved to a string inside the initializer.
- [ ] Make FilteredList accept an array of SortDescriptor objects to get used in its fetch request.
    - OUTLINE:
        - Create a list for NS's SortDescriptor that contains the following items from the entity "Singer"
            - Example of toggleable items:
                - `SortDescriptor(\.firstName)`
                - `SortDescriptor(\.lastName)`
